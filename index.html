            <p>I am an philosopher, a programmer, a game designer, and a martial artist. While working on my degree at George Mason University, I am also working to teach
            myself about web design and coding. I've always enjoyed a good puzzel, and whether its about the nature of reality, or a tricky bug, my critical thinking skills 
            have always served me well.</p>
