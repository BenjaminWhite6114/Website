            <p>I am a student at George Mason University, studying both philosophy and computer science. I really enjoy work which engages my critical thinking, and 
          both philosophy and computer science really scratch that itch for me.1Da time eryting wen start, had one Guy. “God, He Talk,” dass who him. God an dat Guy, dey stick togedda, an da Guy stay God fo real kine. 2Dass da Guy, da time eryting start, him an God stay tight wit each odda. 3God wen make eryting, but da way he do um, he tell dis Guy fo do um. No mo notting dis Guy neva make. 4He da Guy, if you like come alive fo real kine, you gotta come by him. Dass da kine life come from him. Wen peopo come alive lidat, jalike dey stay inside one place dat get plenny light. Den dey can see an undastan stuff. 5No matta stay dark, da dark no can pio da light. Erytime get light.
6 Had one guy John dat God sen. 7God sen um fo tell all da peopo wat he know bout da light from God, fo dem trus God cuz a him. Dass his kuleana.
8John, he not da light. He ony come fo tell da peopo dat da light stay fo real. 9Dat time wen John stay teach, jalike da light dass fo real stay come inside da world. Dass da light dat show erybody wass true.
10Dat time, da light dass fo real stay inside da world. Wen God make da world, he da Guy dat do um. But da peopo inside da world, dey neva know who him. 11He come his country, but even his peopo neva come tight wit him. 12But erybody dat come tight wit him an trus him, God give dem da right fo come his kids cuz dey know who him. 13Da way dey born, az not jalike how one faddah like get kids. Dey come God kids cuz God give um his life inside.
14Dat “God, He Talk” Guy, he come one guy dat get one body jalike us guys get. He stay wit us short time, an us see how awesome he stay. He awesome, cuz he da One an ony Boy dat come from da Faddah. He like do plenny good stuff fo us cuz dass how he stay. Eryting he tell bout God stay fo real.
15John, he tell peopo wat he know bout dat Guy. He talk real strong fo all da peopo hear. He tell, “Dis da Guy I wen talk bout wen I tell, ‘Bumbye one Guy goin show up, an dat Guy mo importan den me, cuz he stay awready from befo I born.’ ”
16John talk lidat cuz dat Guy like do real plenny good kine stuff, an he do um fo all us guys erytime. 17Moses wen give oua ancesta guys da Rules From God. Den Jesus Christ, God Spesho Guy, he do plenny good stuff fo us, an eryting he tell us bout God, stay fo real. 18No mo nobody wen see God fo real kine. But ony dat Guy wen see um. No mo anodda guy jalike him cuz he God too. No mo nobody stay mo tight wit his Faddah den him. He da One dat wen show how God stay.
Wat John Da Baptiza Guy Tell
(Matthew 3:1-12; Mark 1:2-8; Luke 3:13-17; Rules Secon Time 18:15; Isaiah 40:3)
19One time, da Jew leada guys sen pries guys an odda guys from da Levi ohana dat help da pries guys. Dey sen um by John fo tell, “Eh, who you?” Dis wat he tell um:
20He neva bulai. He tell um fo real kine, “Lissen! I not da Christ Guy, da Spesho Guy God Goin Sen.”
21 Dey tell John, “Den who you? You Elijah?” He tell, “No, I not.”
Dey tell, “Den you da Spesho Guy dat goin come an talk fo God?” He tell, “No, I not.”
22Dey tell him, “Kay den. Tell us who you. Wat you tell bout you? We gotta tell someting to da guys dat sen us, you know!”
23 John tell da same ting jalike Isaiah tell, da guy dat talk fo God long time befo time,
“I da guy dat talk real strong inside da boonies,
‘Eh, make da road ready fo Da One In Charge.
Make um strait fo him!’ ”
24Some a da guys da Jew leadas wen sen by John, dey Pharisees. 25Dem guys tell him, “Kay den. If you not da Spesho Christ Guy Dat God Goin Sen, an you not Elijah, an you not da Spesho Guy dat goin come an talk fo God, den how come you stay baptize da peopo?”
26John tell um, “I stay baptize da peopo wit watta. Anodda guy stay hea wit you guys, but you guys donno who him. 27I wen start fo teach firs befo him, but I not spesho enuff even fo help him hemo his slippas.” 28All dis happen inside Betany town, da one dat stay da odda side a da Jordan Riva. Dass wea John stay baptize da peopo.
Jesus Jalike God Bebe Sheep
(John 1:15)
29Da nex day John spock Jesus stay coming by him, an he tell, “Eh, you guys, try look da guy ova dea! You know wat? He jalike God bebe sheep fo da sacrifice. He hemo da shame fo da bad kine stuff dat erybody inside da whole world stay do! 30Dis da guy I stay talk bout wen I tell, ‘Bumbye one guy goin show up afta me, but he mo importan den me, cuz he stay befo I born.’ 31I neva know who him befo time. But I stay hea fo da Israel peopo know who him. Dass why I stay baptize peopo wit watta.”
32-33John tell mo plenny bout wat he know. He tell dis: “God wen sen me fo baptize peopo wit watta. He tell me, ‘You goin see my Spesho Spirit come down an stay wit one guy. He da guy goin let my Good An Spesho Spirit take ova my peopo.’ Dat time I wen see one guy, an I neva know who him befo time. But den I see da Good An Spesho Spirit come down from da sky jalike one dove, an stay wit da guy.
34“I wen see dat, an I tell you guys, dat guy, he God Boy!”
Da Firs Guys Jesus Pick Fo Teach
35Da nex day John stay stan dea one mo time wit two guys he stay teach. 36Wen John spock Jesus stay walk by him, he tell, “Look! Dis guy jalike God bebe sheep fo da sacrifice.”
37Da two guys hear him tell dat, an dey go wit Jesus. 38Jesus turn aroun an see dem stay going wit him. He tell, “Eh, wat you guys looking fo?”
Dey tell, “Rabbi, wea you stay staying at now?” (“Rabbi,” dat mean “Teacha” dea language.)
39Jesus tell, “Go come look.” So dey go wit him an see wea he stay, an dey stay dea wit him dat day. Was bout four clock in da aftanoon.
40Andrew, Simon Peter braddah, he one a da two guys dat hear John Da Baptiza guy, an go wit Jesus. 41Da firs ting Andrew do, he find his braddah Simon an tell him, “Us wen find da Messiah.” (“Messiah,” dat mean “da Christ Guy, da Spesho Guy God Wen Sen,” dea language.) 42Den he bring Simon to Jesus.
Jesus look at um an tell, “You Simon, an yoa faddah John, aah? but not da Baptiza guy. From now peopo goin call you ‘Cefas.’ ” (Dat mean “Peter,” o “Da Rock,” in dea language.)
Jesus Tell Philip An Natanael Fo Come
43Da nex day Jesus like go Galilee side. He find Philip an tell him, “Eh, come wit me, an be my guy.” 44Philip, he from Betsaida town, da same place Andrew an Peter live. 45Philip find Natanael an tell um, “We wen find da Guy dat Moses write bout in da book wit da Rules From God inside. An da guys dat talk fo God long time befo time, dey write bout him too. He Jesus from Nazaret town, Joseph boy.”
46Natanael tell, “Nah! No mo notting good come from Nazaret!”
Philip tell, “Go come check um out!”
47Jesus spock Natanael stay come by him, an he tell, “Dis guy one fo real kine Israel guy. No mo notting fake inside him! He erytime tell da trut.”
48Natanael tell, “How come you know who me?”
Jesus tell, “I wen see you da time you was undaneat da fig tree, befo Philip tell you fo come.”
49Den Natanael tell him, “Teacha, you God Boy fo real kine! You da King fo da Israel peopo!”
50Jesus tell him, “You wen trus me jus cuz I tell you dat I wen see you undaneat da fig tree, aah?! Fo shua, you goin see mo betta stuff den dat!”
